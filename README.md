# Dot dot dot - Blog CMS
A minimalist blog CMS built with TypeScript with features like publishing a blog, viewing other blogs, as well as creating and deleting blog posts.

During this project I got the opportunity to develop my TypeScript skills, I also got to continue practicing testing with Cypress.
