# Dot dot dot - Blog CMS
A minimalist blog CMS built with TypeScript with features like creating a blog, viewing other blogs, as well as writing and deleting posts.

During this project I got the opportunity to continue developing my TypeScript skills, as well as practicing test driven development with Cypress.
