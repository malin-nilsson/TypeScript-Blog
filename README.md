# Dot dot dot - Blog CMS
A minimalist blog CMS built with TypeScript with features like publishing a blog, viewing other blogs, as well as creating and deleting blog posts. 

During this project I had the opportunity to develop my TypeScript skills and practice unit testing with Cypress. I also got to see how far I could push the vanilla tools since I built this project without a framework or database, only utilizing local storage.
